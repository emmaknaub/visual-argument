# Radiate

In my visual argument, the lights represent each person's "soul," and the brightness of the light represents the goodness or pureness of the soul. I'd like to leave he rest of the meaning up to the viewer's interpretation, but I have some guiding questions: If people's "lights" were all that anyone could see, would you be a better person? Would you try to make your light shine brighter? What's stopping you from doing that right now?
